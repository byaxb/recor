Title: Rearrangement Correlation Coefficient
Version: 1.0.3
Authors@R: person("Xinbo", "Ai", email = "axb@bupt.edu.cn", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculate the Rearrangement Correlation Coefficient, an adjusted version of Pearson's correlation coefficient that accurately measures monotonic dependence relationships, including both linear and nonlinear associations. Addresses the underestimation problem of classical correlation coefficients in nonlinear monotonic scenarios through improved statistical bounds derived from rearrangement inequalities.
