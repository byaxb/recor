Description: recor is an R package that implements the Rearrangement Correlation Coefficient, an adjusted version of Pearson's correlation coefficient designed to accurately measure arbitrary monotone dependence relationships (both linear and nonlinear). Based on cutting-edge statistical research, this package addresses the underestimation problem of classical correlation coefficients in nonlinear monotone scenarios. The rearrangement correlation is derived from a tighter inequality than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, providing sharper bounds and expanded capture range.
